# Caleb Rivers Portfolio

## Purpose

My purpose was to create a simple website where people could easily learn about me,
connect with me as a web developer in training.

## Functionality and Features

I wanted to keep it simple and minimal, with neat connections between each page. I linked my resume and socials so people can connect with me and find out more information easily. I also made sure it had alt text so that it was able to be read by screen readers.
